  t(" are the room dimensions. These resonances create uneven frequency response that degrades audio reproduction quality."),
]));

children.push(numbered("Existing methods for room acoustic analysis require specialized equipment and controlled conditions. Transfer function measurement systems such as Smaart (Rational Acoustics, approximately $800 USD) and Room EQ Wizard (REW) require calibrated measurement microphones, dedicated test signals (pink noise or swept sine), and an empty venue free of audience noise. Dirac Live and Sonarworks similarly require controlled measurement conditions. These requirements limit the practicality of room analysis, particularly in live performance settings where the venue cannot be emptied and test signals would disrupt ongoing activities."));

children.push(numbered("Separately, the field of acoustic feedback detection addresses the problem of identifying \"howling\" or \"ringing\" frequencies in sound reinforcement systems. Feedback occurs when sound from a loudspeaker is captured by a microphone and re-amplified, creating a closed electroacoustic loop that sustains oscillation at one or more frequencies. Prior art in feedback detection includes the Magnitude Slope Deviation (MSD) method described by Rohdenburg et al. (DAFx-16, Aalto University, 2016), phase coherence analysis using circular statistics (Fisher, 1993), and the comprehensive survey by van Waterschoot and Moonen (Proc. IEEE, 2011)."));

children.push(numbered("However, no system in the prior art performs real-time room acoustic analysis using ambient sound as the excitation source, without requiring test signals, calibrated measurement microphones, or prior room configuration. There exists a need for a system that can identify room resonance modes in real-time using only a standard microphone and ambient sound, and that can generate parametric equalization correction recommendations automatically."));

// ─── Summary ───
children.push(sectionHeading("Summary of the Invention"));

children.push(numbered("The present invention provides a computer-implemented system and method for real-time acoustic analysis that employs a plurality of detection algorithms operating in concert to identify acoustic phenomena and generate parametric equalization recommendations. In one embodiment, the system employs six detection algorithms augmented by a neural network meta-model, with content-adaptive weighted fusion and multiplicative gate processing."));

children.push(numbered("In a first aspect, the invention provides a multi-algorithm fusion system for real-time acoustic analysis comprising: (a) audio capture and spectral analysis via Fast Fourier Transform; (b) spectral peak detection with configurable prominence thresholds; (c) scoring of each detected peak by a plurality of independent detection algorithms; (d) content-adaptive weighted fusion of algorithm scores; (e) multiplicative gate processing for false positive suppression; and (f) parametric equalization recommendation generation based on psychoacoustic scaling."));

children.push(numbered("In a second aspect, the invention provides a method for room acoustic resonance analysis comprising operating the multi-algorithm fusion system at elevated sensitivity (prominence threshold below approximately 8 dB) in the absence of an electroacoustic feedback loop, whereby the system detects room acoustic resonance modes as spectral peaks satisfying the detection criteria, and generates parametric equalization recommendations constituting a room correction equalization profile."));

children.push(numbered("The inventor has discovered that room acoustic resonances and acoustic feedback produce physically identical spectral signatures — both manifest as persistent, narrow, high-Q spectral peaks with stable magnitude and stable phase. Consequently, a system designed to detect feedback inherently detects room resonances when operated at sufficient sensitivity. This emergent behavior transforms a feedback detection system into a room acoustic analyzer requiring no test signal, no calibrated measurement microphone, and no prior room configuration."));

The spectral analysis node performs a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with a window size of 8,192 samples at a sample rate of 48,000 Hz, yielding a frequency resolution of approximately 5.86 Hz per bin. In an alternative embodiment, a 16,384-sample FFT window provides approximately 2.93 Hz resolution. The FFT analysis is performed at a rate of 50 frames per second (20 ms intervals)."),

Content type is determined in real-time by a 4-feature scoring system using spectral centroid, spectral rolloff, spectral flatness, and crest factor with temporal envelope analysis over 2-second windows and majority-vote smoothing over 10 frames."),
