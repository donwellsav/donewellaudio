# CLAUDE.md — DoneWell Audio Project Intelligence

> **Last updated April 2026. 483 TypeScript/TSX files, 1261 tests (1257 pass, 4 skip), 66 suites. Version 0.61.0.**
> Signal tint toggle. Severity-graded fade. Issue card redesign (frequency hero, severity icons, icon legend). GEQ/RTA hover tooltips. Low signal hysteresis. Canvas color token system. Design system audit (93/100). 5 rounds Codex adversarial fixes. Scroll-wheel settings. Click-to-edit controls. 33+ codebase improvements.

## CRITICAL RULES

- **NEVER run `git push` unless the user explicitly says "push" or "send to GitHub".** Committing locally is fine. Pushing is NOT. No exceptions.
- **Build verification after every change:** `npx tsc --noEmit && pnpm test`
- **Do not modify audio output.** DoneWell Audio is analysis-only. It listens and advises. It never modifies the audio signal.

## Risk-First Planning

When the user asks you to plan, design, build, or change anything non-trivial:

1. **RISK ASSESSMENT first.** Before proposing HOW, identify WHAT COULD GO WRONG:
   - Which of the 16 Change Impact Audit systems does this touch? List them.
   - What are 2-3 failure modes, edge cases, or unintended consequences?
   - What assumptions are we making? What DON'T we know?
   - What is the blast radius if this goes wrong? (isolated file vs. hot path vs. entire audio pipeline)
   - Are there ordering dependencies? (e.g., "must update types before updating consumers")

2. **Challenge your own plan.** After presenting the implementation approach, add a "Devil's Advocate" section:
   - "A skeptic would ask: ..."
   - "This could fail if: ..."
   - "We're assuming X, but if X is wrong: ..."

3. **Scope declaration.** Before writing any code, declare the PLANNED SCOPE:
   - Files to modify (full paths)
   - Systems affected (from Change Impact Audit table)
   - Files explicitly NOT being modified

This scope declaration becomes the baseline for scope drift detection during implementation.

For trivial changes (typo, comment, single-value tweak), say "TRIVIAL — skipping risk assessment" and proceed.

## 3-Ring Safety Architecture

Three concentric trust rings enforce correctness and prevent accidental or coerced harm:

- **Outer ring (GitHub):** Branch rulesets on `main` (no direct push, required CI), CODEOWNERS, production environment with required reviewer, pinned Actions versions. Repo-owner managed — not Claude's concern.
- **Middle ring (Managed Claude Policy):** Anthropic policy layer. Claude never bypasses `--no-verify`, force-pushes `main`, or takes destructive actions without explicit user direction.
- **Inner ring (Repo-local hooks):** `.claude/hooks/` — mechanically enforced in every session:

| Hook | Event | What it enforces |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `claim-contract.js` | UserPromptSubmit | Every response must have a verifiable factual basis |
| `bash-protection.js` | PreToolUse/Bash | Blocks rm hooks, write to markers, force push, hard reset, direct push to main |
| `deploy-guard.js` | PreToolUse/Bash | Blocks `vercel deploy` / `npx vercel` without approved deploy marker |
| `pre-commit-gate.js` | PreToolUse/Bash | Blocks `git commit` unless build gate passed + CIA Phase 2 audit present |
| `cia-planning-gate.js` | PreToolUse/Edit\|Write | Enforces Phase 1 CIA (risk assessment) before non-trivial edits |
| `prose-fact-gate.js` | PreToolUse/Edit\|Write | Blocks hard factual claims in prose without evidence |
| `file-protection.js` | PreToolUse/Edit\|Write | Protects hooks/, settings files, CI workflows, control-plane files |
| `evidence-ledger.js` | PostToolUse/all | Appends every tool result as evidence to `%TEMP%/claude-evidence-ledger.jsonl` |
| `build-gate-marker.js` | PostToolUse/Bash | Writes build-gate marker (with tree hash) only when tsc + tests both pass |
| `session-cleanup.js` | SessionEnd | Cleans per-session temp directories |
| `fabrication-verifier.md` | Stop+SubagentStop | Agent hook: compares response claims against ledger; blocks unsupported hard claims |

### Two-Phase Change Impact Audit (CIA)

**Phase 1 — Planning gate** (before writing code): Identify affected systems from the 16-system table, 2-3 failure modes, blast radius, ordering dependencies. Required for non-trivial changes.

**Phase 2 — Pre-commit gate** (before `git commit`): Impact table + verdict. Must cover all systems touched. Written to `%TEMP%/claude-cia-audit.md`. `pre-commit-gate.js` reads and validates before allowing the commit.

The pre-commit hook also checks a `build-gate-marker` (tsc + tests must have passed on the current tree hash) and runs as `ask` (not auto-allow) so every commit requires explicit user approval.

## Git Workflow

- **Push + PR: allowed.** Claude can push feature branches and open PRs. Don merges on GitHub — Claude never merges on GitHub.
- **Never merge on GitHub.** Only Don merges PRs via the GitHub UI.
- **Always `git fetch origin`** before reporting version numbers, branch status, or sync state. Stale local refs cause wrong version info.
- **Never amend published commits** or force-push unless explicitly asked.
- **`git commit` routes through `pre-commit-gate.js`** — build gate + CIA Phase 2 required. Hook returns `ask` so you approve each commit explicitly.

### Multi-machine sync (pulling from GitHub)

Use this on any machine to get the latest merged work from GitHub:

```bash
git pull origin main        # Download everything merged on GitHub → update local
```

**Routine:** Run `git pull origin main` first thing whenever starting work on any machine.

**First time on a new machine:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/donwellsav/donewellaudio.git
cd donewellaudio
pnpm install
```
Then `git pull origin main` going forward.

**Typical multi-machine flow:**
1. Merge PR on GitHub
2. On every other machine: `git pull origin main` → all machines in sync
3. Start new work on whichever machine, push branch, open PR, repeat

## Version Release Checklist

When the user asks to cut a release or "update the usuals":

1. Update `lib/changelog.ts` — add entry with version, date, changes
2. Update `components/analyzer/help/GuideTab.tsx` — fix any stale references
3. Update `package.json` version — `0.{next_PR_number}.0`
4. Update `CLAUDE.md` header — version, test count, file count, summary line
5. Commit locally
6. **Wait for user approval** before pushing, creating PR, or merging

## Project Overview

**DoneWell Audio** (donewellaudio.com) is a browser-based real-time acoustic feedback detection PWA for live sound engineers. It captures microphone input via the Web Audio API, identifies feedback frequencies using seven fused detection algorithms (six classical + ML), and delivers EQ recommendations with pitch translation. Version 0.52.0. Repository: github.com/donwellsav/donewellaudio.

## Architecture

### Audio Pipeline

```
Mic -> getUserMedia -> GainNode -> AnalyserNode (8192 FFT)
  -> FeedbackDetector.analyze() at 50fps (main thread)
    -> Peak detection with MSD/prominence/persistence
    -> postMessage(peak, spectrum, timeDomain) [transferable]
      -> Web Worker: AlgorithmEngine.computeScores()
      -> fuseAlgorithmResults() [content-adaptive weights]
      -> classifyTrackWithAlgorithms() [11 features]
      -> shouldReportIssue() [mode-specific gate]
      -> generateEQAdvisory() [GEQ + PEQ + shelf + pitch]
      -> AdvisoryManager.createOrUpdate() [3-layer dedup]
      -> postMessage(advisory) back to main thread
        -> useAdvisoryMap [O(1) Map, sorted cache, dirty flag]
        -> React render -> Canvas spectrum + Advisory cards
```

### Thread Model

- **Main thread:** AudioContext, AnalyserNode, FeedbackDetector (peak detection), requestAnimationFrame (canvas 30fps), React rendering
- **Web Worker:** Classification, algorithm fusion, EQ advisory, track management. Communicates via transferable Float32Arrays (zero-copy).

### Context Providers (top to bottom)

1. `AudioAnalyzerProvider` — Compound provider nesting 4 focused contexts:
   - `EngineContext` (11 fields) — isRunning, start/stop, devices, dspWorker
   - `SettingsContext` (5 fields) — settings, updateSettings, mode/freq changes
   - `DetectionContext` (3 fields) — advisories, earlyWarning
   - `MeteringContext` (10 fields) — spectrumRef, inputLevel, autoGain, noiseFloor
2. `AdvisoryContext` — Advisory state, dismiss/clear/false-positive, derived booleans
3. `UIContext` — Mobile tab, freeze, fullscreen, layout reset
4. `PortalContainerContext` — Portal mount for mobile overlays

## Seven Detection Algorithms (Six Classical + ML)

| # | Algorithm | Source | What It Measures | DEFAULT | SPEECH | MUSIC | COMP |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------------|---------|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | MSD | DAFx-16, Aalto 2016 | Magnitude stability (feedback=0, music>>0) | 0.27 | 0.30 | 0.07 | 0.11 |
| 2 | Phase Coherence | KU Leuven 2025 | Frame-to-frame phase stability | 0.23 | 0.22 | 0.32 | 0.27 |
| 3 | Spectral Flatness | Glasberg-Moore | Geometric/arithmetic mean + kurtosis + crest | 0.11 | 0.09 | 0.09 | 0.16 |
| 4 | Comb Pattern | DBX whitepaper | Evenly-spaced peaks from acoustic loop | 0.07 | 0.04 | 0.07 | 0.07 |
| 5 | IHR | Novel | Inter-harmonic energy ratio | 0.12 | 0.09 | 0.22 | 0.16 |
| 6 | PTMR | Novel | Peak-to-median ratio | 0.10 | 0.16 | 0.13 | 0.13 |
| 7 | ML (ONNX) | Bootstrap MLP | 11-feature MLP 11→32→16→1 (929 params, 4KB) | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.10 |

### Multiplicative Gates (post-fusion and classifier)

- **IHR gate:** When harmonicsFound>=3 AND IHR>0.35, feedbackProbability *= 0.65 (instrument suppression). File: `algorithmFusion.ts`
- **PTMR gate:** When PTMR feedbackScore under 0.2, feedbackProbability *= 0.80 (broad peak suppression). File: `algorithmFusion.ts`
- **Formant gate:** When 2+ active peaks fall in distinct vocal formant bands (F1/F2/F3) AND current peak Q is 3–20, pFeedback *= 0.65. Suppresses sustained vowel FP. File: `classifier.ts`
- **Chromatic quantization gate:** When peak frequency snaps to 12-TET semitone grid (±5 cents) AND phase coherence > 0.80, phase score contribution scaled by 0.60 (40% reduction). Suppresses Auto-Tune FP. File: `classifier.ts`
- **Comb stability gate:** CombStabilityTracker monitors fundamentalSpacing CV across 16 frames. When CV > 0.05 (sweeping), comb confidence *= 0.25. Suppresses flanger/phaser FP. File: `algorithmFusion.ts`
- **Mains hum gate:** When peak is within ±2 Hz of a mains harmonic (50n or 60n Hz) AND 2+ other active peaks match the same series AND phase coherence > 0.70, pFeedback *= 0.40. Auto-detects 50 vs 60 Hz. Suppresses HVAC/electrical equipment FP. File: `classifier.ts`

## Known Bugs

All previously tracked bugs (P1–P3) have been resolved as of v0.127.0. All Phase 0 control surface bugs (B1–B7) are resolved as of v0.14.0. See git history for details.

## Known False Positives

| Scenario | Mode | Original Prob | Mitigation | Status |
|----------|------|--------------|------------|--------|
| Sustained vowel | Speech | 0.703 | Formant gate: pFeedback *= 0.65 when 2+ formant bands active + Q 3–20 (`classifier.ts`) | **MITIGATED** |
| Auto-Tuned vocal | Compressed | 0.785 | Chromatic quantization gate: phase boost *= 0.60 when frequency on 12-TET grid ±5 cents + coherence > 0.80 (`classifier.ts`) | **MITIGATED** |
| Flanger/phaser pedal | Music | 0.681 | CombStabilityTracker: comb confidence *= 0.25 when spacing CV > 0.05 over 16 frames (`algorithmFusion.ts`) | **MITIGATED** |
| HVAC/mains hum | All | ~0.80 | Mains hum gate: pFeedback *= 0.40 when peak on 50n/60n Hz series + 2 corroborating peaks + phase coherence > 0.70 (`classifier.ts`) | **MITIGATED** |

## Key Performance Constraints

- **FeedbackDetector.analyze() is the hot path.** Runs every 20ms (50fps). Every optimization matters.
- **MSD uses pooled sparse allocation:** 256 slots x 64 frames = 64KB (vs 1MB dense). O(1) slot allocation, O(256) LRU eviction.
- **Prefix sum for O(1) prominence:** Float64Array prefix sum enables neighborhood averaging without per-bin loops.
- **EXP_LUT:** 1301-entry precomputed dB-to-linear table [-100, +30] dB. Use instead of Math.pow() in hot loops.
- **Skip-threshold:** Bins 12dB below threshold skip the LUT entirely.
- **Canvas at 30fps (default), not 60fps.** Sufficient for spectrum visualization. Grid cached as Path2D, log-scale math hoisted outside loops.
- **Worker backpressure:** If worker is still processing, next peak is DROPPED (not queued). Real-time > completeness.
- **Transferable buffers:** spectrum and timeDomain Float32Arrays are transferred (zero-copy) to worker, then returned via `returnBuffers` message. No allocation after init.

## Coding Conventions

- **Components:** PascalCase, `memo()`, `'use client'` directive
- **Hooks:** `use` prefix, camelCase
- **Types:** PascalCase interfaces in `types/advisory.ts`, `types/calibration.ts`, `types/data.ts`
- **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE in `lib/dsp/constants.ts` (single source of truth)
- **Private members:** `_prefixed`
- **Imports:** Always `@/*` path alias
- **Canvas functions:** Pure (no React deps), take ctx + dimensions + data as params. Theme colors via `canvasThemeRef.current` (ref, not state — avoids re-render, read in RAF loop)
- **Styling:** Tailwind utilities + `cn()` from `lib/utils.ts`
- **JSDoc:** Required on all DSP functions. Include academic references.
- **Testing:** Vitest. Co-located unit tests in `__tests__/`, scenario tests in `tests/dsp/`
- **ESLint:** Flat config, `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: error`. React 19 experimental rules downgraded to warn.
- **Build gate:** `npx tsc --noEmit && pnpm test && pnpm build` — all must pass
- **Export formats:** PDF uses dynamic `import()` to avoid bundling jsPDF unless needed; CSV/JSON/TXT are synchronous

## Operation Modes (8 presets in constants.ts)

| Mode | Threshold (dB) | Silence (dBFS) | MSD Weight | Use Case |
|------|---------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| speech | 27 | -65 | 0.33 | Conferences, lectures |
| worship | 35 | -58 | 0.33 | Churches (reverberant) |
| liveMusic | 42 | -45 | 0.08 | Concerts (dense harmonics) |
| theater | 28 | -58 | 0.33 | Drama, musicals |
| monitors | 15 | -45 | 0.33 | Stage wedges (fastest) |
| ringOut | 2 | -70 | 0.33 | Calibration (most sensitive) |
| broadcast | 22 | -70 | 0.33 | Studios, podcasts |
| outdoor | 38 | -45 | 0.33 | Festivals (wind-resistant) |

## CI/CD

- **Build gate:** `ci.yml` — audit + tsc + lint + test + build on every push/PR
- **Dependency updates:** Dependabot — weekly npm PRs (grouped by prod/dev), monthly Actions PRs
- **Versioning:** `0.{PR_NUMBER}.0` on PR merge, patch increment on direct push. Both `[skip ci]`.
- **Deployment:** Vercel auto-deploys on push to `main`
- **Version flow:** `package.json` version -> `next.config.mjs` reads via `readFileSync` -> `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` env -> HeaderBar + HelpMenu

## Deployment

- **Vercel auto-deploys** on push to `main`. Every merge is a production deploy.
- **Post-deploy verification:** After deploying or making production changes, verify the deployment is working (check the live URL, not just CI green).
- **Hotfix protocol:** If a deploy breaks production, immediately create a hotfix branch, fix, and ship. Don't wait for a full PR review cycle.

## Testing / Validation

- **Run `npx tsc --noEmit`** after making TypeScript changes to catch type errors before committing.
- **Run `pnpm test`** after any DSP, hook, or context changes.
- **Build gate:** `npx tsc --noEmit && pnpm test` — both must pass before committing.
- **Canvas changes** require visual verification in the browser (type-check won't catch drawing bugs).

## Change Impact Audit (MANDATORY — enforced by hooks)

After making **any non-trivial change** to the codebase, produce a **Change Impact Audit** before committing. The audit classifies the change as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL across every affected system. Evidence-backed, not opinion-based.

**Pre-commit workflow (enforced by `.claude/hooks/pre-commit-gate.js`):**
1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit && pnpm test` — the build gate hook writes a marker on success
2. Produce the CIA in conversation AND write it to a temp file: `Write the CIA audit to the OS temp directory as claude-cia-audit.md`
3. Only then run `git commit` — the pre-commit hook checks both markers exist

If either marker is missing, the commit will be **mechanically blocked**. This is not optional.

### When to produce an audit

Always. If you changed code, you audit it. Specifically:

| System | Trigger files/areas |
|--------|-------------------|
| DSP / Detection | `lib/dsp/*`, algorithm weights, thresholds, gates, fusion, MSD, peak detection |
| Audio Pipeline | Gain, FFT, calibration, A-weighting, Web Audio API, mic input |
| Worker / Threading | `dspWorker.ts`, `workerFft.ts`, postMessage, transferables, backpressure |
| React State | Contexts (`contexts/*`), hooks (`hooks/*`), prop drilling, re-renders |
| UI Components | `components/*`, layout, mobile/desktop, tabs, sheets, gestures |
| Canvas / Visualization | `spectrumDrawing.ts`, RTA, GEQ, overlays, markers, labels, theme colors |
| Settings / Storage | `dwaStorage.ts`, localStorage keys, defaults, migration, presets |
| PWA / Service Worker | `sw.ts`, Serwist config, offline caching, installability |
| Security / CSP | `middleware.ts`, nonce generation, headers, API validation |
| API / Ingest | `api/v1/ingest/route.ts`, schema validation, rate limiting |
| Testing | `vitest.config.ts`, test files, mocks, coverage |
| Build / CI | `next.config.mjs`, `ci.yml`, Turbopack, webpack, Vercel deploy |
| Accessibility | ARIA roles, focus management, touch targets, screen readers, color contrast |
| Performance | Hot path (50fps analyze), Canvas (30fps), bundle size, memory, LUT |
| ML Pipeline | ONNX model, inference, training data, snapshot collection |
| Data / Privacy | Consent, snapshot collection, PII, opt-in, GDPR |

### Audit format

**CHANGE:** [one-line description]
**CLASSIFICATION:** 🟢 POSITIVE | 🔴 NEGATIVE | ⚪ NEUTRAL
**SCOPE:** [which systems from the table above are touched]

**Proof of impact** (adapt to change type):

For **DSP/algorithm** changes — trace values through the pipeline with actual numbers:
- Input range → transform → output range
- Which thresholds/decision boundaries are crossed or not
- dB values, bin indices, LUT ranges, frame counts

For **UI/component** changes — trace the render and interaction path:
- Which components re-render and why (prop/context/state change)
- Mobile vs desktop behavior differences
- Touch target sizes, viewport breakpoints affected
- Accessibility: does keyboard nav / screen reader still work?

For **state/storage** changes — trace data flow and persistence:
- Which contexts consume this state? How many components re-render?
- Does localStorage format change? What happens to existing users' saved data?
- Are defaults preserved? Does migration handle old → new format?

For **security/CSP** changes — trace the trust boundary:
- Does this open a new vector? (XSS, injection, data leak)
- Does CSP still block inline scripts in prod?
- Are API inputs still validated and rate-limited?

For **performance** changes — quantify the cost:
- Hot path impact: added operations × 50fps × 4096 bins = total ops/sec
- Memory: new allocations, array sizes, GC pressure
- Bundle: does this add a new dependency? Lazy-loaded or eager?

For **build/deploy** changes — trace the pipeline:
- Does CI still gate on tsc + lint + test + build?
- Does Vercel deploy behavior change?
- Are environment variables still wired correctly?

**Impact table:**

| System | Impact | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| [each affected system] | 🟢/🔴/⚪ None/Improved/Degraded | [one-line proof] |

**Verdict:** [Summary — "Strict improvement because..." / "Trade-off: improves X but risks Y..." / "Functionally invariant because..."]

### Classification rules

- **🟢 POSITIVE:** Provably improves at least one system without degrading any other. Improvement must be non-trivial.
- **🔴 NEGATIVE:** May degrade any system, even if it improves others. Must flag the trade-off and **require user acknowledgment** before committing.
- **⚪ NEUTRAL:** Mathematically/logically invariant — affected values never reach a decision boundary, affected components never see different inputs. Must prove it.
- **MIXED (🟢+⚪):** Common — positive for one system, neutral for all others. List both.
- **MIXED (🟢+🔴):** Requires explicit user approval. Present the trade-off clearly.

### Quick audit (for small changes)

For trivial changes (typo fix, comment update, import reorder), a one-line audit is sufficient:

**CHANGE:** Fixed typo in HeaderBar tooltip | **CLASSIFICATION:** ⚪ NEUTRAL | **Verdict:** Text-only change, no logic/state/render impact.

### Example

**CHANGE:** Removed pre-calibration clamp `db = clamp(db, -100, 0)` in `_buildPowerSpectrum()`
**CLASSIFICATION:** ⚪ NEUTRAL (feedback detection) + 🟢 POSITIVE (room analysis)
**SCOPE:** DSP / Detection, Audio Pipeline

| System | Impact | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Peak detection | ⚪ None | Affected bins < -100 dB, never cross any threshold (min 2 dB prominence) |
| MSD / algorithms | ⚪ None | Only peak bins written to MSD history |
| Room analysis | 🟢 Improved | Quiet low-freq signals no longer artificially raised before calibration offset |

**Verdict:** Strict improvement — removes artificial floor that lost precision for room analysis, while being mathematically invariant for all feedback detection paths.

## "Update the Usuals" Workflow

When the user says "update the usuals" or "update the usual stuff", do all of these:

1. **Changelog** (`lib/changelog.ts`) — add entry for new version with all features/fixes
2. **Help menu** (`components/analyzer/help/GuideTab.tsx`) — update any stale references
3. **Version** (`package.json`) — bump to `0.{next_PR_number}.0`
4. **CLAUDE.md** — update header (version, test count, file count, summary line)

Then when user says "PR":
5. Commit locally, create feature branch, push, `gh pr create`
6. **Stop.** Don merges on GitHub — Claude never merges.

**NEVER push unless the user explicitly says "push", "PR", or "send to GitHub".**

## Security Notes

- **CSP:** Nonce-based `script-src` in prod (middleware.ts), `'unsafe-inline'` in dev for hot reload. `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` in both (required by Tailwind/React). `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` and `<body>` to prevent nonce mismatch (browsers strip nonce from DOM).
- **Permissions-Policy:** `microphone=(self), camera=(), geolocation=()`
- **Zero XSS vectors:** No direct HTML injection, no dynamic code execution
- **API:** Ingest endpoint validates v1.0/v1.1/v1.2 schema, dual rate-limiting (IP-based 30/60s primary + session-based 6/60s secondary), actual body size enforcement (512KB), strips IP, error messages not leaked
- **Worker:** Inbound messages type-validated via `WorkerOutboundMessage` switch; outbound postMessage lacks compile-time Set validation (minor gap)
- **localStorage:** 37 touchpoints, all via dwaStorage.ts abstraction with try/catch
- **Companion proxy:** SSRF-hardened public HTTP proxy (`app/api/companion/proxy/route.ts`): Origin header check (defense-in-depth, spoofable by non-browser clients — not a true auth boundary), HTTP-only (HTTPS blocked), 13 IPv4 special-use ranges blocked (RFC 1918, loopback, link-local, CGNAT, TEST-NETs, benchmarking, reserved; does NOT cover multicast 224/4 or 6to4 relay 192.88.99/24), all-IPv6 blocked, DNS resolution via OS resolver with 2s timeout, IP pinning (TOCTOU-safe for HTTP), dual-stack IPv4 filtering, manual redirect re-validation per hop, 307/308 method preservation, 1MB response cap, rate limiting (30 req/60s per IP via `x-forwarded-for` — trusted on Vercel, spoofable elsewhere), redirect exhaustion → 502, distinct error codes (403/429/504/502). **Known gaps:** no unforgeable auth (Origin is spoofable), IP-based rate limiting depends on platform-sanitized headers. Public HTTP endpoints only — LAN Companion uses relay.
- **Companion relay:** Rate-limited (30 req/min per IP, amortized Map pruning), payload shape validated before storage (`app/api/companion/relay/[code]/route.ts`)
- **Pairing codes:** `crypto.getRandomValues()` (not Math.random()), 6-char alphanumeric (`lib/companion/companionBridge.ts`)

## Accessibility Notes

- **MobileLayout:** Exemplary WAI-ARIA tabs (roving tabindex, ArrowLeft/Right/Home/End)
- **Color contrast:** All combinations pass WCAG AA (lowest: 5.1:1 destructive red on dark bg)
- **Canvas:** Not directly accessible to screen readers. Mitigated via `aria-live="polite"` region in IssuesList.tsx that announces new detections (frequency, severity, EQ recommendation) throttled to 1 per 3s.
- **Touch targets:** All >=44x44px on mobile (`touchFriendly`). Desktop action buttons (FALSE+, CONFIRM, Copy) h-8 with min-w-[44px]. Dismiss uses min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] on both layouts.
- **Focus indicators:** Standardized `focus-visible:ring-[3px]` across all component files. Matches shadcn button.tsx ring width.
- **Skip link:** "Skip to main content" link in layout.tsx, visible on keyboard focus (WCAG 2.4.1).
- **Reduced motion:** `prefers-reduced-motion` blanket in globals.css — suppresses all CSS transitions and animations for motion-sensitive users.
- **Touch optimization:** `touch-action: manipulation` (eliminates 300ms tap delay) and `overscroll-behavior: contain` (prevents accidental pull-to-refresh) on `html`.

## Data Privacy

- **Analysis:** All audio processing runs locally in the browser. No audio is transmitted.
- **Data collection:** Anonymous spectral snapshots (opt-in). No PII. Random session UUIDs. IP stripped server-side.
- **Consent:** Opt-in model — user must tap "Share Data" before collection begins. EU/EEA/UK users see full GDPR disclosures (Article 6(1)(a) legal basis, 24-month retention, data subject rights, Supabase storage location). `ConsentJurisdiction` tracked in localStorage. Geo detection via `/api/geo` (Vercel `x-vercel-ip-country` header, fail-open). `CONSENT_VERSION=2`; v1→v2 migration preserves existing consent status.
- **Storage:** Settings and history in localStorage only. Never transmitted unless user explicitly exports.

## ML Data Pipeline (v0.106.0+)

- **Snapshot enrichment:** Every `FeedbackMarker` includes `MarkerAlgorithmScores` with all 6 algorithm scores (MSD, phase, spectral, comb, IHR, PTMR) plus fused probability and confidence. Schema version `1.1` (backward-compatible with `1.0`).
- **Ground truth labeling:** Always-on FALSE+ button on every advisory card (not just calibration mode). User feedback flows via `userFeedback` worker message to `snapshotCollector.applyUserFeedback()`, labeling pending batch events as `correct` or `false_positive`.
- **Ingest API v1.1:** `app/api/v1/ingest/route.ts` accepts optional `algorithmScores` and `userFeedback` fields with validation. Backward-compatible — v1.0 payloads still accepted.
- **Data flow:** Advisory card → `handleFalsePositive()` in `AudioAnalyzer.tsx` → `dspWorker.sendUserFeedback()` → worker `applyUserFeedback()` → snapshot batch labeled for future ML training.
- **ML inference (v0.128.0):** ONNX Runtime Web as 7th fusion algorithm (weight 0.10). Bootstrap model (929 params, MLP 11→32→16→1) encodes existing gate logic. Lazy-loaded in worker via `import('onnxruntime-web')`. `predictCached()` pattern: async inference with synchronous cached reads. Previous-frame fused probability breaks circular dependency.
- **CONFIRM button (v0.128.0):** Symmetric labeling alongside FALSE+ for balanced ML training data. Mutual exclusion: CONFIRM removes from fpIds, FALSE+ removes from confirmedIds. Label balance tracking in snapshotCollector.
- **Cloud training pipeline (v0.128.0):** Supabase `spectral_snapshots` table with 12 ML columns. `scripts/ml/` with numpy-only trainer, export script, bootstrap model generator. GitHub Actions workflow (`ml-train.yml`) for weekly scheduled or manual training runs.
- **Ingest API v1.2 (v0.128.0):** Accepts `confirmed_feedback` user feedback, ML algorithm score, and model version. Backward-compatible with v1.0/v1.1.

## UI Features

### Operator Color Vocabulary (3 colors)
- **Amber** (`--console-amber`) — Detection: sensitivity, mode, thresholds, algorithms, panel chrome labels
- **Blue** (`--console-blue`) — Scope/range: frequency range, FFT, timing, peak detection
- **Green** (`--console-green`, `#4ADE80` dark / `#22c55e` light) — System/processing: auto-gain, noise floor, track management, room presets, calibration
- Action buttons (Save, Export, Download, Next) stay `bg-primary` blue — they are interactive triggers, not panel chrome
- Severity colors (RUNAWAY red, GROWING orange, etc.) are independent of the operator vocabulary

### Amber Sidecar Theme
- **Signal-responsive tint:** `--tint-r/g/b` CSS vars on `:root` drive all amber-tinted surfaces. `useSignalTint` hook (in HeaderBar) maps worst detection severity → color: idle=slate, listening=blue, detection=amber, warning=orange, RUNAWAY=red. 500ms CSS transitions, 1s downgrade hysteresis, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
- **Overlay scoping:** `[data-slot="sheet-content"]` pins `--tint-*` to amber — Help, History, Settings sheets stay branded regardless of detection state.
- **RUNAWAY boost:** `.tint-runaway` class on `<html>` doubles alpha on headers/sidebars/glow lines for emergency visibility.
- **Canvas code:** Cannot use CSS `var()` directly — use `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--tint-r')` to read tint values for `ctx.fillStyle`/`ctx.strokeStyle`.
- **`--console-amber` is static** — always `#f59e0b` (dark) / `#d97706` (light). Used for text labels in the operator vocabulary. Surface tinting uses `rgba(var(--tint-r),...)` directly, never through `--console-amber`. Do not make `--console-amber` dynamic.
- All panels use `amber-sidecar` class for cascade styling (accordion triggers, section labels)
- `amber-panel-header` class for gradient header bars — requires compound selector when combined with `panel-header` or `channel-strip` (CSS specificity: later rules override equal-specificity earlier rules)
- `instrument-window-amber` class for graph panel bezel borders
- Pattern: `style={{ color: 'var(--console-X)' }}` inline overrides `.amber-sidecar .section-label` cascade
- CSS multiple backgrounds for layering: `.channel-strip.amber-panel-header { background: amberGradient, darkGradient; }`

### Help Menu Structure
- `HelpShared.tsx`: `HelpSection` (card with `color` prop) + `HelpGroup` (collapsible accordion)
- Every `HelpSection` must be inside a `HelpGroup` — no orphaned cards
- Color mapping: amber = detection topics, blue = scope/analysis + Help menu, green = system/environment
- **Help menu uses `--console-blue`** — it's reference documentation (scope/analysis), not detection controls. All Help text, icons, tab borders, and accordion labels are blue.

### Layout & Navigation
- **Dual entry point:** Two start buttons — "Press to Start Analysis" (normal mode) and "Ring Out Room" (ring-out wizard). No settings menu required to switch modes.
- **Desktop layout:** 3-panel — Controls sidebar | Issues panel | RTA + GEQ graphs. 4-tab settings (Live | Setup | Display | Advanced) with accordion sections per tab. Fader strip (w-20, 80px) on far right.
- **Mobile portrait (2-tab):** Tab 1 = Issues + inline resizable RTA/GEQ graph (drag handle to resize, swipe to switch RTA↔GEQ). Tab 2 = Settings. Graph tab removed — graphs are inline above cards.
- **Mobile landscape:** 40/55/5 split (Issues/Graph/Controls). `LandscapeSettingsSheet.tsx` for bottom-sheet settings.
- **Fullscreen:** Separate app fullscreen (Maximize2 icon) and RTA fullscreen (Expand icon). Distinct icons and behavior.

### Issue Cards & Labeling
- **Swipe gestures (v0.148.0):** Swipe left = dismiss (removes from view). Swipe right = confirm as real feedback. Long-press = flag as false positive. 60px threshold, vertical-scroll-safe. Mobile always-on, desktop opt-in via Display settings.
- **Issue card display:** PEQ-only recommendations. Copy button. 3s minimum display time for stability. Top 5 on mobile (`MOBILE_MAX_DISPLAYED_ISSUES`).
- **Algorithm scores debug:** Toggle in Display settings shows MSD/PH/SP/CM/IH/PT/ML scores on each card.

### Theme & Branding
- **Dark/light theme (v0.146.0):** `next-themes` with CSS variables. Canvas colors via `canvasThemeRef` pattern (ref updated on theme change, read in RAF loop). Amber sidecar theme throughout — header, controls, issues, graphs, fader, help, history panels all use `channel-strip` + `amber-panel-header` + operator color vocabulary. RTA labels use frosted glass pills with theme-aware fills, shadows, and accent strips (v0.167.0).
- **DWA brand logo:** PNG-based DW Audio logo with theme switching. `DwaLogo.tsx` component. Displays in header (64px) and start button (80px).
- **Full names:** "Real-Time Analyzer" / "Graphic Equalizer" labels when space allows, abbreviated on narrow screens.

### Ring-Out Wizard (v0.147.0)
- **Guided workflow:** Step-by-step — "Raise gain slowly" → feedback detected → shows EQ cut recommendation → "Apply cut, click Next" → repeat. Running list of all notched frequencies.
- **Auto-starts in ringOut mode** with 2dB threshold (maximum sensitivity). Session summary with all cuts, exportable.

### Detection & Analysis
- **Content type detection:** 4-feature scoring (centroid, rolloff, flatness, crest factor) with temporal envelope analysis (energy variance over 2s windows). Majority-vote smoothing over 10 frames.
- **Sensitivity guidance (v0.151.0):** Three-layer contextual hints — idle hint below start buttons, first-detection tooltip, persistent RTA label next to threshold line. Speech/ringOut default 27dB.
- **RTA label overlap suppression (v0.170.0):** Greedy algorithm prioritizes highest-severity labels with 16px collision padding. Nearby suppressed labels merge into range pills ("820–950 Hz ×3") with highlight bands.
- **Frequency zone overlay (v0.171.0):** 5 theme-aware bands (Sub/Low Mid/Mid/Presence/Air) with separate dark/light opacity arrays. Merged range labels get filled highlight bands.
- **Notch overlays (v0.179.0):** Advisory merge at 1000 cents (minor seventh) — nearby EQ bands consolidate into one wider-Q cut via `clusterAwareQ()`. 42% opacity for fill and marker lines. Visual bars merge with 3% plot-width gap threshold, 8px minimum width. Marker line skipped when notch exists. `drawNotchOverlays()` returns notched ID set consumed by `drawMarkers()`.
- **Draggable threshold line:** Drag the dashed line on the RTA to adjust sensitivity directly. 8×28px grab handle with notch affordance.

### Settings Persistence
- **Auto-persist:** All 47 settings fields saved to localStorage on every change via `dwaStorage.ts`. Loaded on mount with `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` as fallback.
- **Custom presets:** Save/load named presets (up to 5). Mode selector + saved presets in Detect accordion.

### Issue Card Design
- **Frequency hero:** `text-3xl` (4xl for RUNAWAY), `font-black`, severity-colored with LED glow text-shadow. The most important element in the app — readable from across the room.
- **Severity icons:** Lucide icons replace text labels — `Zap` (RUNAWAY), `ArrowUpRight` (GROWING), `Radio` (RESONANCE), `CircleDot` (POSSIBLE_RING), `Waves` (WHISTLE), `Music` (INSTRUMENT). Exported as `SEVERITY_ICON` from `IssueCard.tsx`.
- **2-row layout:** Row 1: severity icon + frequency + pitch + badges. Row 2: PEQ rec + velocity + actions (single horizontal row).
- **Icon legend:** `SeverityLegend` component at bottom of IssuesList, shows all 6 icons with labels and colors.
- **CONFIRM FEEDBACK:** Two-line button label — "CONFIRM" with "FEEDBACK" subscript (7px, 60% opacity) for clarity.
- **Severity-graded fade:** RUNAWAY = instant (no animation), all others = 5s opacity fade via `issue-enter-slow` keyframes. Strip accent uses matching `strip-fade-in`.

### Signal Tint
- **Signal Tint toggle:** `signalTintEnabled` in Display settings (default: true). When off, console stays neutral slate gray — colors only appear when they mean something.
- **Low signal hysteresis:** `useLowSignal` hook debounces the green↔blue empty state transition. 3.5s enter delay, 5s exit delay, 2s CSS opacity crossfade. Both states always rendered (no mount/unmount flicker).

### Hover Tooltips
- **GEQ bar tooltips:** HTML overlay on hover — shows band frequency, cut dB, exact peak Hz, cluster merge count. Hit-tests against cached bar layout.
- **RTA advisory tooltips:** Enhanced canvas tooltip when cursor is within 100 cents of a marker — shows severity, confidence, PEQ cut/Q, velocity. Severity accent strip on tooltip left edge. Falls back to basic freq+dB readout when no marker nearby.
- **Marker label suppression:** Frequency pill labels temporarily hide when cursor is nearby (uses full label x-range, not just center). Dots and vertical lines remain for spatial context.

### Canvas Token System
- **`lib/canvas/canvasTokens.ts`:** Shared canvas color constants — `meterBg()`, `applyMeterStops()`, `geqBg/geqGrid/geqCenter()`, `confidenceColor()`, `RUNAWAY_COLOR`, `OVERLAY_TEXT`, `OVERLAY_ACCENT`, `GEQ_AXIS_LABEL_LIGHT`.
- **Design system score:** 93/100 — only 2 shadcn upstream `bg-[#111214]` remain as hardcoded hex.

### Scroll-Wheel & Click-to-Edit Controls
- **`useWheelStep` hook:** Focus-gated scroll-wheel step adjustment via native `addEventListener('wheel', handler, { passive: false })`. Click to focus, scroll to adjust, click away to release. Hold Shift for fine-stepping (step/10).
- **ConsoleSlider click-to-edit:** Click value readout → text input → Enter commits, Escape cancels. Supports locale comma decimal separators.
- **ResetDefault component:** `RotateCcw` icon, only renders when value ≠ default. Per-setting reset-to-default across all tabs.

### Other
- **Permanent Clear All:** Trash icon in header, calls `onClearAll()` + `onClearGEQ()` + `onClearRTA()`.
- **Auto MEMS calibration:** Smartphone MEMS mic profile auto-applied on mobile.
- **onnxruntime-web warning suppressed (v0.150.0):** String-concatenated dynamic import avoids Turbopack static analysis. No functional change.
- **Brand logos:** 24 DoneWell brand PNGs in `public/logos/` (DW-audio, DW-av, DW-video, DW-master variants in black/white/transparent).
